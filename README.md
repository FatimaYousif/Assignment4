FIRST EVER COMPLETE WEBSITE( With HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP)

     ...               HIJAB HOUSE WEBSITE CLONE                ...

I have always been too inspired by the hijabi girls of the west, and I got to explore their website one day to which I loved the layout of
the website, because of this reason I made a clone of the Hijab house website. I couldn't be more proud to make one for the hijabi girls 
of Pakistan.
